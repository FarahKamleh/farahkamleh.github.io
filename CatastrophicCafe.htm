            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">A serious multiplayer networked game following the theme "Computer Architecture and Cats", Cat-astrophic Cafe 
                intends to educate the player on the concept of caching. During the game, players take banana smoothie and banana sundae orders at a cat cafe and 
                deliver them to customers. The ingredients are stored in fridges at opposing sides of the preparation areas, so the players must be diligent in 
                selecting the correct ingredients to store on the counter between both players which is representative of the cache.</p>

            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Theme Fulfillment</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">The theme of the project is "Computer Architecture and Cats". The intention of the game is to educate the players 
                about the usefulness of caching, placing emphasis on quicker access and temporary storage. Because the fridges are on opposing sides of the room with 
                opposing ingredients, having the players run across the room to gather what they need is inefficient. Therefore, the counter in between both players 
                with four baskets must be used to store ingredients that they need. This will allow the players to complete their tasks within the time limit.</p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">The counter is representative of the cache. It only has four baskets which communicates the limited storage of 
                cache memory. In addition, having ingredients placed in the center where both players have quick access showcases the time reduction achieved by 
                caching. In other words, data can now be served faster. Lastly, the location is a cat cafe where the employees and the customers are all cats in 
                banana costumes which matches the items they are serving: banana smoothies and banana sundaes.</p>
