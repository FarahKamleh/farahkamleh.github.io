            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Project Description</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">A serious multiplayer networked game following the theme "Computer Architecture and Cats", Cat-astrophic Cafe 
                intends to educate the player on the concept of caching. During the game, players take banana smoothie and banana sundae orders at a cat cafe and 
                deliver them to customers. The ingredients are stored in fridges at opposing sides of the preparation areas, so the players must be diligent in 
                selecting the correct ingredients to store on the counter between both players which is representative of the cache.</p>
            <div class = "row">

            </div>
            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Theme Fulfillment</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">The theme of the project is "Computer Architecture and Cats". The intention of the game is to educate the players 
                about the usefulness of caching, placing emphasis on quicker access and temporary storage. Because the fridges are on opposing sides of the room with 
                opposing ingredients, having the players run across the room to gather what they need is inefficient. Therefore, the counter in between both players 
                with four baskets must be used to store ingredients that they need. This will allow the players to complete their tasks within the time limit.</p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">The counter is representative of the cache. It only has four baskets which communicates the limited storage of 
                cache memory. In addition, having ingredients placed in the center where both players have quick access showcases the time reduction achieved by 
                caching. In other words, data can now be served faster. Lastly, the location is a cat cafe where the employees and the customers are all cats in 
                banana costumes which matches the items they are serving: banana smoothies and banana sundaes.</p>

            <h2 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Formal Elements</h2>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">The objective of the game is to prepare all of the smoothie and sundae orders within the time limit of three minutes. 
                As a result, the objective may be loosely categorized as Construction, due to the "building" of orders, or Solution, due to the solving of a problem before 
                the time limit. The player interaction pattern is Cooperative Play. One player is responsible for creating the smoothie orders while the other is responsible 
                for creating the sundae orders. The ingredients are on the opposite sides, so the players must work together to send items to each other using the counter which 
                is representative of the cache.
            </p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">The most important rule of the game is that players are limited to their side of the "kitchen". Player #1 can only prepare smoothie 
                orders, fetch sundae ingredients, and deliver smoothie orders. Player #2, on the other hand, can only prepare sundae orders, fetch smoothie ingredients, and deliver sundae orders. 
                The layout of the kitchen is intentionally inefficient to require collaboration.</p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Limited resources provide much-needed challenge to a game. In Cat-astrophic Cafe, the time limit, ingredients, and "cache" baskets 
                all serve as limited resources. After the countdown has begun, it can never be reversed. The "cache" baskets on the counter are intentionally limited to four to educate 
                the players about the limited storage space when caching, so they must use the few baskets they have wisely. The non-plain-vanilla procedure/rule of the game is that the 
                cafe layout is inefficient which, as a result, requires collaboration between the players in order to succeed and complete the objective. Another example is the limited number 
                of resources in the fridges that can be carried and exchanged across the counter.

            <h2 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">How to Use</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Cloning Project From GitHub</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45); padding: 5px;">To begin, clone the project from the following link by 
                clicking on the green button that says "Code", selecting the "HTTPS" option, and copying the web URL:</p>
            <a href = "https://github.com/FarahKamleh/Cat-astrophic_Cafe" style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">FarahKamleh/Cat-astrophic_Cafe</a>

            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Installing Git to Clone</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45); padding: 5px;">To download and install Git, navigate to the following webpage and select the option for your device:</p>
            <a href = "https://git-scm.com/downloads" style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45); padding: 5px;">Afterwards, open Git Bash, change the current working directory to the location of interest, and type "git 
                clone" proceeded by the copied URL. Finally, press the Enter button.</p>
                <div class = "row">
                    <div class = "column">

                </div>
            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Installing Unity and Unity Hub</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45); padding: 5px;">Extract the ZIP file as needed. The next step is to install Unity. To do 
                so, go to https://unity.com and select the blue "Get Started" button at the top. Select the "Individual" tab and click on another 
                blue "Get started" button underneath "Personal". Download Unity Hub for your preferred platform. Install Unity Hub which will host 
                your Unity projects. In Unity Hub, click on "Installs" then "Install Editor" to install a new Unity version. This project uses 
                version 2022.3.15.f1. Visit the download archive at https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive and select Unity 2022.x to find 
                the correct version. Install using Unity Hub. It should then appear there. Open the project by pressing the "Open" button in "Projects".</p>

                    <img src = "2019 Unity Hub.png" alt = "2019 Unity Hub" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%; padding: 5px;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Controls</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45); padding: 5px;">When the game launches, the menu screen, which showcases an eagle eye's view of the kitchen layout, 
                asks that the player press either the "Host" or "Client" button in the top right corner using their mouse. If a "Client", they will first be made to type 
                the randomized Join Code on the screen before entering the game. Upon arrival, a physical collision with the bell on the counter will result in the arrival 
                of the customers from the sky.
            </p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45); padding: 5px;"> To control the Banana Cat Barista, the WASD keys are used to traverse the intentionally limited space. To grab 
                and carry ingredients from the fridge, the cursor of the mouse must hover over the ingredient of interest and be followed by a left mouse click. Grabbing an 
                ingredient results in it levitating above the player's head. To pass the acquired ingredient to the other player, the basket with the correct label should be 
                clicked. Similarly, when building either the banana milkshake or the banana sundae, attempting to add the incorrect ingredient will result in no action. When 
                the order is completed and appears in front of the customer, the order disappears when clicked and adds one point to the score. A temporary work-around, clicking 
                the title of an ingredient will result in its appearance within the basket underneath.

            <h2 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Networking</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Netcode for Game Objects</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Cat-astrophic Cafe uses Netcode for GameObjects which is a high-level networking Unity library to help abstract networking logic. 
                It allows for the sending of GameObjects and other data across a networking session to many players at once.
            </p>

            <h3 style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Necessary Fixes</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(84, 52, 45);">Players are able to successfully join after entering the Join Code on the screen. However, there are a few networking-related fixes 
                that need to be made. For example, the timer in the top left corner is not synched between players. It begins as soon as a player joins, regardless of the presence of 
                other players. Similarly, the ingredient GameObjects are not yet networked. Therefore, as a temporary work-around to ensure all elements of gameplay are still functional, 
                the player can click on the title of the ingredient they need above the four counter-baskets to make it appear.</p>
