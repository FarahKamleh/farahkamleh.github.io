            <h3 style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">Project Description</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">Death Lives, Life Dies is an original two-player VR game developed for the CAVE2 Hybrid Reality Environment in which 
                both players share all 88 screens but do not see the same image. This innovative procedure/rule is accomplished by taking advantage of a stereoscopic 
                shader and giving Player #1, Death, a 2D-R lens configuration and Player #2, Life, a 2D-L lens configuration.

            <h3 style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">Story</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">Although a taker-of-life, Death has never had a life of his own. Jealous, he has determined that, if he cannot have 
                life, then no one can. A newborn has arrived on the scene. Knowing it is not yet their time, Life must prevent Death's killing spree by killing Death 
                himself.</p>

            <h2 style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">Gameplay</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">Players, Objectives, and Conflict</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">As mentioned in the project description, the total number of players is two. With a "Player vs Player" interaction 
                pattern, Player #1 is Death and Player #2 is Life. Death's objective is to locate and eliminate the newborn that is represented by a glowing orb in-game 
                while Life's objective is to locate and eliminate Death.</p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">The conflict of the game is opponent-based. Player #1's Conflict: "The immortal Life intends to stop you from 
                successfully eliminating a newborn by killing you once and for all". Player #2's Conflict: "The vengeful Death intends to rid of a newborn life you 
                have just given prior to its time".</p>
            <h3 style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">Procedures, Rules, and Resources</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">Death's weapon is a scythe which provides close-range attacks. By swinging the controller, Death can not only attack the 
                floating orb, but can also deflect Life's "bullets" as an advantage. Life's weapon is a bow and arrow where the arrows are seed-like bullets. With their far-range
                attacks, Life must aim and shoot to hit their moving target Death. Being immortal, Life's advantage is that they cannot die. Both players move throughout the maze 
                using the analog stick and can activate special items using the L2 button.</p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">For the rules, players can only carry one special item at a time. Every special item on the map is single-use and will not respawn. 
                It takes a total of five hits in order to defeat Death and the newborn. While Life cannot die, Death and the newborn cannot return lost health/heal. Discussed in 
                further detail in the "Innovative Procedure/Rule" section, players share the same surround-sound audio, but do not share the same visuals.</p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 76, 92);">In terms of resources, the newborn and Death have healthbars that contain a total of five "hearts". Death's "hearts" are represented 
                by skulls while the newborn's "hearts" are represented by souls. One of the special items that can be acquired in the maze can cage a player in order to stall them. 
                Death cages life between tombstones while Life cages Death between trees. Lastly, there are two "helpers" hidden in the maze: a skeleton and a wolf. The skeleton 
                serves as Death's helper while the wolf serves as Life's helper. When Death is within range of the skeleton, it guides him towards the newborn for a short duration,
                then disappears. When Life is within range of the skeleton, the skeleton chases them and traps them within tombstones. Likewise, when Life is near the wolf, it 
                temporarily guides them towards Death's location. When Death approaches the wolf, it chases him until he is trapped between trees.</p>
