            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 68, 44); padding: 5px;">Advocating for the inclusion of Middle Eastern 
                North African (MENA) as a category on the U.S. Census and other surveys that take into account race 
                and ethnicity, Count (ME)NA In is a Virtual Reality (VR) experience that simulates, through a first-person 
                perspective, a few of the obstacles and challenges faced by MENA individuals as a result of their erasure. 
                In order to inspire and initiate change, the project not only spreads awareness about this lesser acknowledged 
                form of racial discrimination, but also proposes community as a potential solution, as it is through the
                activism of communities that most change occurs. Designed for the CAVE2 Hybrid Reality
                Environment, the project focuses on the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal of Reduced Inequality.</p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 68, 44);">The premise of the project is that the player, a Middle Eastern North 
                African (MENA) student, is applying to a university as well as a minority-specific scholarship that they are 
                qualified for based on the required criteria. As they do so, they are asked to provide the race that they 
                identify with, only to be surrounded by options that, although many, do not include them. Throughout, the 
                thoughts of the student are present above their head, expressing how each selection makes them feel. In 
                addition, derogatory words associated with each selection follow them wherever they go as though they are 
                inescapable. The further they walk along the path, the more they witness and experience their own erasure. 
                When they begin to feel that inclusion is an impossibility, they suddenly find solidarity among community 
                members. They too agree that the U.S. Census and other similar surveys must count MENA in!</p>

            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 68, 44); padding: 5px;">To begin, download the project from the following link by 
                        clicking on the green button that says "Code" and selecting "Download ZIP":</p>

            <h3 style = "color: rgb(16, 68, 44);">Installing Unity and Unity Hub</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgb(16, 68, 44); padding: 5px;">Extract the ZIP file as needed. The next step is to install Unity. To do 
                so, go to https://unity.com and select the blue "Get Started" button at the top. Select the "Individual" tab and click on another 
                blue "Get started" button underneath "Personal". Download Unity Hub for your preferred platform. Install Unity Hub which will host 
                your Unity projects. In Unity Hub, click on "Installs" then "Install Editor" to install a new Unity version. This project uses 
                version 2019.2.11. Visit the download archive at https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive and select Unity 2019.x to find 
                the correct version. Install using Unity Hub. It should then appear there. Open the project by pressing the "Open" button in "Projects". 
                Alternatively, after having downloaded and extracted the ZIP, locate the Output folder which contains a Unity executable which allows for 
                playing the game inside a window without having to open it in the Unity Editor.</p>

                using a desktop. To move the player, use the WASD keys on the keyboard. To rotate the player's view, press Q and E. Majority of the interactions 
                are collision-based. Therefore, in order to open the doors or collect the typography, the player must bump into the objects. To apply 
                when instructed, press the up arrow on the keyboard. Lastly, to take action and toss the words, hover the mouse over the words of interest, then press 
                and release the left mouse button as desired.</p>
