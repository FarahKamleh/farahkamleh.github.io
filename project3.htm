            <h1 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">Project 3 - Our House</h1>
            <h2 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">Introduction</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">Project Description</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">Given a 3D model of the new Computer Science building in construction at the University of Illinois 
                at Chicago, this project focuses on providing the user with an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experience at building-scale. Loosely modeled after 
                the Mega Pizzaplex from the video game Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach (2021), the user can explore the building and interact with objects 
                within reach through the use of a Virtual Reality headset.</p>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src = "Statue Comparison.png" alt = "Statue Comparison" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">As shown in the image comparison above, the Golden Freddy statue found in the game has been included in the project 
                to make it resemble the Mega Pizzaplex.</p>
            <h3 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">How To Use the Application</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">In order to use the application, one must first download the project from 
                GitHub and install the necessary software. Assuming that the steps described in the section titled "Instructions to Build and 
                Run" have been followed, the user can now explore the Security Breach-themed building. The user can pick up and toss ten items 
                which are a Fazer Blaster, a flashlight, a noise maker, a paper cup, a pizza, a cupcake, a wet floor bot, a puppet mask, a 
                stroller, and a Bonnie plush. They can also interact with objects that produce duplicates. Pressing the buttons of the oven results in 
                duplicates of Mr. Cupcake and a pizza. Pressing the button on the side of the flashlight charger dispenses flashlights. Lastly, 
                spinning the handle of the prize box spawns Bonnie plushes. Additionally, the user can pull levers to change aspects of the scene. 
                One lever changes Sundrop to Moondrop while the other triggers the lights and theme music of the hidden stage. In order to better 
                traverse the space, the user can teleport to six locations using the charging stations.</p>
            <div class = "row">

            <h3 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">Downloading Project from GitHub</h1>
            <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">To begin, download the project from the following link by clicking on the 
            green button that says "Code" and selecting "Download ZIP":</p>
            <a href = "https://github.com/FarahKamleh/Group4.Project3" style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">Group4.Project3</a>

            <h3 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">Installing Unity and Unity Hub</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">Extract the ZIP file as needed. The next step is to install Unity. To do 
            so, go to https://unity.com and select the blue "Get Started" button at the top. Select the "Individual" tab and click on another 
            blue "Get started" button underneath "Personal". Download Unity Hub for your preferred platform. Install Unity Hub which will host 
            your Unity projects. In Unity Hub, click on "Installs" then "Install Editor" to install a new Unity version. This project uses 
            version 2021.3.6f1. Visit the download archive at https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive and select Unity 2021.x to find 
            the correct version. Install using Unity Hub. It should then appear there. Open the project by pressing the "Open" button in "Projects". 
            While not required to download and install, it should be noted that the project makes use of VRTK version 4.</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img src = "Unity Hub Installs.png" alt = "Unity Hub Installs" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%; padding: 5px;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">Building and Running on the Quest</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">Connect the Quest headset to the laptop using a suitable USB cable. Put on the Quest 
            headset and use the controllers to tell the Quest to accept the PC connection and always allow that connection. Make sure developer mode is 
            on. Click on the Quick Settings menu on the left side of the thin menu, then click on the settings menu on the upper right. Next, scroll 
            down in the menu on the left to Developer and turn on the USB Connection Dialog.</p>
        <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">In the hierarchy of the Unity project, make sure CameraRigs.UnityXRPluginFramework is 
            enabled while CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator is disabled. Under Unity Build Settings, make sure you are building for the Android Platform 
            and the Quest connected shows up under the Run Device list of compatible connected devices. If it does not show up, unplug and re-plug the 
            USB cable, then tell the Quest to accept the connection to the laptop again. Save the project and restart Unity.</p>
        <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">Click on Build and Run. It should take about 5 to 10 minutes for Unity to convert 
            all the assets to a form suitable for the Quest. Disconnect the USB cable from the Quest, put on the Quest headset, and grab the two 
            controllers. The app should start automatically.</p>

        <ol type = "1">
            <li style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); text-align: left;">Ball Pit: Modeled by Silver, the ball pit serves as the fourth model larger than 
                a human. It is also the first to use a lever that changes aspects of the scene. Pulling the lever changes Sundrop to Moondrop and triggers the
