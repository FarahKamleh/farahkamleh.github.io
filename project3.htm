            <h3 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">Project Description</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">Given a 3D model of the new Computer Science building in construction at the University of Illinois 
                at Chicago, this project focuses on providing the user with an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experience at building-scale. Loosely modeled after 
                the Mega Pizzaplex from the video game Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach (2021), the user can explore the building and interact with objects 
                within reach through the use of a Virtual Reality headset.</p>

            </div>
            <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">As shown in the image comparison above, the Golden Freddy statue found in the game has been included in the project 
                to make it resemble the Mega Pizzaplex.</p>
            <h3 style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44);">How To Use the Application</h3>
            <p style = "color: rgba(196, 42, 44); padding: 5px;">In order to use the application, one must first download the project from 
                GitHub and install the necessary software. Assuming that the steps described in the section titled "Instructions to Build and 
                Run" have been followed, the user can now explore the Security Breach-themed building. The user can pick up and toss ten items 
                which are a Fazer Blaster, a flashlight, a noise maker, a paper cup, a pizza, a cupcake, a wet floor bot, a puppet mask, a 
                stroller, and a Bonnie plush. They can also interact with objects that produce duplicates. Pressing the buttons of the oven results in 
                duplicates of Mr. Cupcake and a pizza. Pressing the button on the side of the flashlight charger dispenses flashlights. Lastly, 
                spinning the handle of the prize box spawns Bonnie plushes. Additionally, the user can pull levers to change aspects of the scene. 
                One lever changes Sundrop to Moondrop while the other triggers the lights and theme music of the hidden stage. In order to better 
                traverse the space, the user can teleport to six locations using the charging stations.</p>
