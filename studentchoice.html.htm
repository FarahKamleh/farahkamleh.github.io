            <h2 style = "color: gray;">Introduction</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: gray;">What Is It?</h3>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">Released on October 11th, 2016 for PlayStation 4 and April 25th, 
                2017 for Microsoft Windows (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Valve Index VR), Batman: Arkham VR is a video 
                game developed by London-based Rocksteady Studios that utilizes virtual reality for its gameplay. 
                It is the first installment in the Batman: Arkham series to use virtual reality headsets, allowing the 
                user to experience Gotham City from the perspective of the caped crusader himself. The primary focus 
                of the game is an investigative experience in which the user explores their immediate environment and 
                solves mysterious puzzles. Using Batman's investigative skills and expensive gadgets, the 
                user, serving as the world's greatest detective, races to uncover the disappearance of his long-time 
                allies, Nightwing and Robin.</p>

            <h3 style = "color: gray;">Gameplay</h3>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">Using virtual reality headsets like PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, and 
                Oculus Rift, Batman: Arkham VR is a first-person adventure game that allows the player to see through the 
                eyes of Batman and interact with his surroundings using the associated controllers. Unlike the previous 
                Arkham games, Batman: Arkham VR does not include any combat, focusing instead on solving puzzles. To do 
                so, the player can freely look around the environment, interact with objects in reach, and access three 
                gadgets from Batman's utility belt: a grappling hook, a forensic scanner, and the classic batarang. The 
                scanner can be used to examine evidence and recreate crime scenes. Although the player cannot walk freely, 
                they can teleport to preset locations and the environment they are in.</p>

            <h2 style = "color: gray;">Intended Users</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: gray;">Who Are Its Intended Users?</h3>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">Considering that, at its core, Batman: 
                Arkham VR is a video game, the target demographic is people who play video games. Additionally, because 
                the game makes extensive use of Batman's long-running comic mythos, it is also intended for fans of the 
                caped crusader and the DC universe in general. By slapping the name "Arkham" on the title and embedding 
                the game's story within that of the Arkham series, which chronologically includes Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), 
                Batman: Arkham City (2011), Batman: Arkham Origins (2013), and Batman: Arkham Knight (2015), the game 
                especially caters to those fond of the Arkham game series.</p>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src = "Batman Arkham Series.png" alt = "Batman Arkham Series" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2 style = "color: gray;">Use of VR</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: gray;">Why Is It a Good Use of VR?</h3>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">When evaluating any application or 
                piece of hardware that makes use of virtual reality, the following are important elements to consider: 
                visuals, audio, tracking, interaction, collaboration, and, arguably the most important, immersion. 
                Intended as a single-player experience, Batman: Arkham VR was not developed with collaboration in mind; 
                therefore, the application will not be evaluated for its implementation of the aforementioned element, 
                or, more specifically, its lack thereof.</p>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">By observing the elements listed above, 
                a conclusion regarding whether or not Batman: Arkham VR is a good use of virtual reality will be formulated. 
                For starters, virtual reality heavily emphasizes the immersion of the user. The intention of Batman: Arkham 
                VR is to immerse the player into Batman's world by allowing them to be Batman himself. To do so, the user, through 
                the game's 3D visuals, explores iconic locations from Wayne Manor to the Batcave. Using the optical tracking system 
                of the head-mounted display, the user performs their exploration by looking all around them as they would in a real 
                space with the visuals updating in real-time. The sense of depth created using occlusion, perspective projection, 
                lighting, and shadows increases the immersion. For example, in the introduction, the user is perched on the roof of the GCPD 
                building near the Bat Signal. The sense of depth not only showcases just how large a city Gotham City is, but also just 
                how high Batman is perched.</p>  
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src = "Sense of Depth.jpg" alt = "Sense of Depth" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The use of ambient audio increases the immersion by setting the 
                mood of the virtual environment. For example, when Bruce wakes up in the morning after having fallen asleep against a grand piano, 
                not only is there sunlight peeking through the windows, but the chirping of birds can be heard from the outdoors. Similarly, when, 
                for example, a phone is ringing, the audio, as it would in the real world, is directional and can draw the user's attention towards 
                it. Objects that the user interacts with, whether that be opening a drawer or spinning a globe, trigger a sound to notify them that an action 
                has been registered and completed. Of the more impressive interactive objects in the game is the grand piano found in Wayne Manor. The 
                user can use Bruce's fingers to press individual keys that play the correct notes.</p>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src = "Grand Piano.jpg" alt = "Grand Piano" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">When the user is transported from Wayne Manor to the Batcave using 
                the grand piano, Batman is made to suit-up; when handed his gloves, cowl, and tools, the user's physical tranformation into the caped crusader 
                is finally complete. To further their tranformation beyond the physical, the player can interact with Batman's gadgets and technologies to progress 
                in solving the mystery at hand. Grabbing objects within reach, they can use a grappling hook, a forensic scanner, a batarang, and even the 
                Batcomputer. Assuming the intention of Batman: Arkham VR is to make the player feel that they are Batman, then the game, whether jump-scaring the 
                player with Killer Croc's sudden arrival or making them experience Joker-induced hallucinations first-hand, successfully uses VR in order to do so.</p>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src = "Mirror.jpg" alt = "Mirror" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The player looks themselves in the mirror and sees their reflection as Batman.</p>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src = "Batcomputer.jpg" alt = "Batcomputer" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The Batcomputer from the first-person perspective of the user.</p>

            <h2 style = "color: gray;">Positive and Negative Aspects</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: gray;">What Are the Issues (Positive and Negative) With It?</h3>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">With players of all skill levels in mind, the game ensures, 
                through character dialog, that it is clear what must be done in order to progress in the story. For example, when Nightwing's 
                lifeless body is found, Batman enunciates, "Analyzing Nightwing with the Forensics Scanner will help me identify the killer", 
                informing the player that, in order to progress, they must use the forensic scanner in their utility belt. However, tasks are 
                not always made as clear, especially for players who are beginners or have little to no experience with VR. For example, when 
                in the Batcave, Alfred only nudges, "Hopefully the Batcomputer can help you pinpoint [Nightwing and Robin's] location". It is 
                never made explicit that the user can, in that moment, open a drawer to discover vials of blood in need of analysis. Similarly, 
                it is not clear through visual cues which objects are interactive and which are not. For comparison, when using the grappling 
                hook, it is clear to the user which locations can be traveled to thanks to a light blue circle that is accompanied by the name 
                of the "sub-location" (e.g. Bat Garage and Case Files)</p>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src = "Grappling Hook Circle.jpg" alt = "Grappling Hook Circle" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The grappling hook serves as a form of transportation in 
                the game, as it "teleports" Batman from one area of the virtual environment in question to another. Beyond teleporting, Batman: 
                Arkham VR does not allow the user to walk in the real world with a reflected change in the virtual world; players are expected 
                to remain in place while only their heads and hands are being tracked. When visiting the Bat Garage prior to starting the mission, 
                the user is made to select a mode of transportation among a list of iconic Batman vehicles. When a vehicle, like the Batmobile, is 
                selected, the user is immediately transported to the intended destination. If the user is to be limited to a single sitting position 
                like that of a driver, then why not include a feature in which the user takes control of the Batmobile and drives it? The visuals 
                presented through the windshield can update based on the steering direction of the player.</p>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "column">
                    <img src = "Batmobile.jpg" alt = "Batmobile" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">

            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">In the video above, the player demonstrates the way in which, 
                using a single finger per hand, the grand piano located in Wayne Manor plays the correct note. The player has chosen to perform 
                "Welcome to the Black Parade" by My Chemical Romance.</p>

            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">In the sequence above, the player arrives in the Batcave and 
                begins to "suit-up". They are donned with Batman's uniform, gloves, cowl, and utilities. Afterwards, they are made to look 
                themselves in the mirror and stand face-to-face with their reflection as the Batman himself.</p>
            <h3 style = "color: gray;">The Ending - A Killer Revealed</h3>
            <iframe width="90%" height="90%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6-Ms1dphkho?start=193" title="Batman Arkham VR Ending" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p style = "color: gray; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">It can be argued that Batman: Arkham VR's immersion is strongest 
                at the end when Nightwing's killer is revealed. It should be noted that, in order to briefly explain its effectiveness, spoilers will be 
                discussed. When the lights go out in Arkham Asylum, Batman finds himself trapped within a cell. This is the start of a hallucination 
                that, through its use of strong visuals and sounds, reveals that Batman himself, also known as the player, is the killer. Looking around 
                them, the player is made to periodically view themselves in the mirror. By the end, Batman's figure is replaced with that of the Joker, 
                forcing them to finally confront the truth. The sequence can be viewed in the video above.</p>
