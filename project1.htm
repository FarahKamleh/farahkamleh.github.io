        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Project Description</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">Suppose, in the future, rather than 
            purchasing a snow globe as a momento of an attraction once visited, one could instead 
            acquire a virtual knickknack that utilizes Augmented Reality (AR). Capable of displaying 
            the time and weather of the chosen locations in real-time, the two knickknacks of this project 
            are representative of the Bill Cipher Statue in Reedsport, Oregon and Pixar Animation 
            Studios in Emeryville, California.</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img src = "Attractions.png" alt = "Attractions" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">Included below are two photos of the 
            project's AR knickknacks representing the same attractions mentioned above. The image on 
            the left is the Bill Cipher Statue in Reedsport, Oregon and the image on the right is Pixar 
            Animation Studios in Emeryville, California. This is how they appear in the view of the camera 
            when the project is running.</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img src = "AR Attractions.png" alt = "AR Attractions" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">

        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">How To Use the Application</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">In order to use the application, one must 
            first download the project from GitHub and install the necessary software. Instructions are 
            included below in the section titled "Instructions to Build and Run". Assuming the 
            instructions have been followed and completed, one should print out and assemble a Merge Cube 
            and a Class Cube. The following is a zip file containing the cubes:</p>
        <a href = "https://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/428/CubesForVuforia.zip" style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Merge Cube and Class Cube Zip File</a>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">When the project is open in Unity, 
            pressing the Play button should access the web camera of the laptop. Holding the Merge 
            Cube in the view of the camera should allow the user to see the Reedsport, Oregon 
            knickknack overlayed on the physical cube. Similarly, carrying the Class Cube in 
            the camera's view should allow them to see the Emeryville, California knickknack. It 
            follows the movement of the physical cube including its rotation. The four sides of the 
            knickknack display the attraction name, a relevant logo, and the time and weather of 
            the actual locations.</p>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">Flipping the cubes upside down changes the knickknack's light 
            conditions. Flipping the Reedsport, Oregon knickknack enables a red light that is similar to 
            that of burning fire. Flipping the Emeryville, California knickknack turns Luxo Jr., the Pixar 
            lamp, on and shines a spotlight on the Luxo ball and the seagull from Finding Nemo (2003) just as it does at the real location at night. 
            Flipping the cubes over again returns the lighting conditions to their defaults. This functionality 
            is demonstrated in the images below.</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">

        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Installing Unity and Unity Hub</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">Extract the ZIP file as needed. The next step is to install Unity. To do 
            so, go to https://unity.com and select the blue "Get Started" button at the top. Select the "Individual" tab and click on another 
            blue "Get started" button underneath "Personal". Download Unity Hub for your preferred platform. Install Unity Hub which will host 
            your Unity projects. In Unity Hub, click on "Installs" then "Install Editor" to install a new Unity version. This project uses 
            version 2021.3.6f1. Visit the download archive at https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive and select Unity 2021.x to find 
            the correct version. Install using Unity Hub. It should then appear there. Open the project by pressing the "Open" button in "Projects".</p>

        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Installing Vuforia</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">Register for a Vuforia account at https://developer.vuforia.com. Download 
            Vuforia 10.9 from https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk. Select "Add Vuforia Engine to a Unity Project or upgrade to the 
            latest version". Follow the steps at https://library.vuforia.com/getting-started/getting-started-vuforia-engine-unity to add 
            Vuforia Engine 10.9 to a Unity Project. The most vital steps are to select Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package -> Import. 
            Because Vuforia adds its own camera, delete the Main Camera in the Scene Hierarchy. A Vuforia App License key must be added to 
            the Vuforia Configuration window in Unity in order for the project to track the cubes. To do so, go to the Vuforia developer 
            site, then click on Develop / License Manager / Get Development Key. This creates a new license key. Return to Unity and add the 
            key through Window / Vuforia Configuration.</p>

        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Student-Made Assets</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">The following list is of all of the models created by me. It should be noted that they have all been created in Unity.</p>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); text-align: left;">Tree: The tree model included in the Reedsport, Oregon knickknack was created by me. 
                It has been painted brown. It serves as the first of two student-made models for a single knickknack.</li>
            <li style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); text-align: left;">Leaves: The leaves floating in the air near Bill Cipher 
                in the Reedsport, Oregon knickknack were also created by me. There are three of them in the scene. They serve as the second of two student-made models.</li>
            <li style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); text-align: left;">Luxo Ball: The Luxo ball in the Emeryville, California knickknack was created by me. Although just a sphere, 
                the texture was difficult to make. I have attempted over twenty textures in order to replicate that of the original Luxo ball to no avail. 
                The version included in the project was the best of them, although still not accurate. It serves as the first of two student-made models for a single knickknack.</li>
            <li style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); text-align: left;">Soccer Goal: The soccer goal located on the Emeryville, California knickknack was created by me 
                as well as its texture/material. It serves as the second of two student-made models for a single knickknack.</li>
        </ol>


        <h2 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Representing the Attractions</h2>
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Bill Cipher Statue - Reedsport, Oregon</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">In the side-by-side comparison below, the left image includes Alex Hirsch, the creator of Gravity Falls (2012), 
            kneeling beside the Bill Cipher Statue the knickknack on the right intends to represent.</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img src = "Oregon Representation.png" alt = "Oregon Representation" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">The model of Bill Cipher stands in place of the statue itself. Behind him is a 
            tree model similar to the one behind the actual statue. Because it has been placed in a forest in Reedsport, Oregon, a tree is included on the knickknack. 
            Similarly, a model of a fern has been placed underneath Bill; in the left image, ferns can be seen sprouting from the ground. The leaves falling from the tree are 
            indicitive of the leaves all over the floor. Although not representing the fictional location of Gravity Falls, the Gravity Falls logo is placed on the cube's front
            surface because Bill Cipher is the main antagonist of the series.</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img src = "Fire Comparison.png" alt = "Fire Comparison" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">Capable of conjuring blue fire, a fire model has been included on the knickknack. Unlike Bill's, the fire 
            model is red rather than blue. This is because it was the default color of the downloaded model. When the knickknack is turned upside down, the red flames illuminate.</p>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">As the knickknack is being carried in the view of a webcamera, two audio tracks play. The first is of Bill Cipher 
            laughing and the second is the Gravity Falls theme. The latter plays on a loop while the former only plays when the knickknack is brought back within view. This is because 
            a looping track of laughter may be considered annoying.</p>
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Pixar Animation Studios - Emeryville, California</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">The side-by-side comparison below shows the front of the Pixar Animation Studios building in Emeryville, California on the left and the 
            knickknack representing it on the right.</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img src = "California Representation.png" alt = "California Representation" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">The model of Luxo Jr., the Pixar lamp, serves as a replica of the massive statue found at the front entrace of 
            Pixar Animation Studios. It faces a similarly large statue of the Luxo ball; therefore, a model of the Luxo ball has been placed in front of the Luxo Jr. model on the knickknack. 
            In the photo included above, if one were to zoom in, they could see a soccer goal in the grass. There is a soccer field located on the campus. This is why a model of a soccer 
            goal has been included. The large white umbrella is representative of the patios found near the entrance. They can be seen in the image at the top of the webpage. The image on the 
            cube's forth surface is one of the logos for Pixar Animation Studios. The last physical model is of a seagull from Finding Nemo (2003). It has been included because a statue of the 
            bird sits atop the building. Extremely tiny, it can be seen in the photo above. Below is a close-up:</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img src = "Seagull.jpg" alt = "Seagull" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">At night, the Luxo Jr. lamp turns on and shines a spotlight on the Luxo ball. This is why, when the cube is flipped upside down, the 
            Luxo Jr. lamp turns on.</p>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img src = "Luxo Jr. Night.jpg" alt = "Luxo Jr. Night" style = "width: 95%; height: 95%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">Lastly, the looping audio included is that of the Pixar intro: the sound of Luxo Jr. hopping towards the letter I in the Pixar 
            name and gleefully pouncing atop it.</p>

        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">Potential Popularity</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">The given prompt questions whether or not AR objects such as the knickknacks created in this project will become popular in several 
            years when, for example, AR-enhanced eye wear is commonplace. In the case of this project, one of the advantages an AR knickknack has over a real, physical knickknack, such as a snow 
            globe, is that it cannot be physically destroyed or damaged. However, it can be argued that, similarly, it can eventually be "lost" when programs and/or software become outdated or even abandoned. To 
            conclude that AR objects embedded in the real world will not be popular based on the disadvantage just presented does not take into account previous patterns of active human interaction and participation with AR.
            Take, for instance, the sudden boom in popularity of the 2016 augmented reality mobile game Pokemon Go. It can be strongly argued that it became a cultural phenomenon at launch, garnering 
            about $207 million in revenue during its first active month. At the time, it became the most downloaded mobile application in a mere twenty days, quickly finding its way to the top of most international 
            charts. Not only were fans of Pokemon actively playing the game, but also those who may have been unfamiliar with the popular game-series-turned-multi-media-franchise. After it took off, one could find 
            news article after news article featuring coverage of the game and its popularity. Even today in the year 2022, about six years after its initial release, it still remains active. Therefore, using the popularity 
            of Pokemon Go as an exemplary case in point, in the instance where AR is utilized in a way that is engaging for the average user, it has the potential to be popular in several years and, as demonstrated, even now.</p>

        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203);">AR-Enhanced Small Objects</h3>
        <p style = "color: rgb(82, 166, 203); padding: 5px;">As of now, AR, as well as the small objects that are enhanced by the aforementioned mixed environment, are commonly used for entertainment purposes. Like the 
            example given above, mobile games like Pokemon Go and social media platforms like Snapchat use AR technology to insert a small, interactive character, whether that be a Pokemon or a 3D customized avatar of the user,
            in the real-world space captured by the camera of a smartphone. Thinking beyond entertainment, small objects enhanced by AR can be beneficial in a classroom setting or even at the gym. For example, rather than having 
            to carry around an expensive smart watch that may get lost and constantly needs to be charged in order to simply take note of the number of steps taken, one could have an application that utilizes AR to provide vital health information
            in mere seconds. Suppose that, by simply hovering a smartphone camera in front of a human body, the application can provide the individual's weight and heart rate placed against the captured footage in real-time. Similarly, in a 
            biology course, by placing a 3D model in the real world, AR can be used to visualize small organisms that otherwise cannot be seen by the human eye. As proposed, there are small objects in the real world that can benefit 
            from being AR-enhanced.</p>
